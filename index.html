<h1>Appearance</h1>
Fractal Wisps are generally very small, only measuring roughly three feet in height. Their bodies are made from black ethereal energies which are very humanoid in appearance despite being little more than shadowy silhouettes. Within the layers of darkness is a bright spiritual light that shines through their eyes, hair, and sometimes even their cores. Their eyes don't separate into pupil or iris, staying one texture and color throughout, and their hair glows with the same color their eyes do, floating about and above their heads as though they are submerged underwater constantly. A Fractal's core is generally located where a human's hear would be in the center of their alleged chest area, and shines brightly when they are using magic, even through the darkness of their "bodies."
<br>
<br>
<h1>Personality</h1>
Her name and emotion of birth are pretty self explanatory: Wonder is a very curious and wide-eyed spirit full of child-like awe. With a constant desire to explore the world around her and learn something new, she often finds herself in trouble. Wonder is also rather easy to impress or fascinate, often making her seem rather childish in nature.
</div>
</div>

<div id="tab1">
<h1>Creation of the Wisps</h1>
In the beginning of existence, even before time itself was a thought, possibilities were endless. Multiple worlds, multiple realities and dimensions, all formed together, all gave birth to life. There were no boundaries, no borders between dimensions, and the lively inhabitants could do as they pleased. Of these inhabitants, three were the most powerful. They were more like a collective of conscious than physical spirits or creatures. They had a wisdom and understanding of existance that far surpassed any living creature. They had names, names in a language that is forever lost to the worlds and beyond human capacity to understand, so currently they may be referred to as Fate, Destiny, and Will. 
<br><br>
Will became very ambitious, it wanted to explore the worlds and create a personal connection with the life it found, so it fashioned itself a form to fit the most common shared species among realities; a form we'd call humanistic today. For some time, Will shared it's--now his--wisdom with the life of the realities, but their own ambitions soon corrupted him. He was filled with the desire to control everything, force it to bend to his every word, and began multiplying with all the different kinds of life, creating armies of god-like beings. 
<br><br>
Horrified, Fate and Destiny quickly acted to save the worlds. They created borders between dimensions and realities, forcing beings born in a certain world to stay in that world. They trapped Will in one of the many worlds this way, and his armies were scattered across existence with no way to carry on. Just when it seemed peace would finally come, beings who practiced magic started finding ways to bypass the boundaries between worlds, and it didn't take long for Will to learn the trick. 
<br><br>
War was no longer avoidable, it was time to create armies of their own. Fate and Destiny worked together to fashion warriors. They created beings to live between worlds in the divides, beings that could actually function and use energy and magic there, live where there is no life, and bring death. These beings were called Will-o'-the-Wisps, and they were designed to follow a commander in their natural order. Together, Fate and Destiny formed what would be the most powerful Wisp, the one who would rule the rest of them. They simply called her "X." 
<br><br>
<h1>Fractal Evolution</h1>
Despite being an artificial intelligence, X was created with the ability to adapt and learn from information she gathered. By watching humans--and human-like creatures--she eventually learned how to develop emotions of her own. Feelings were no longer beyond her reach, but they acted as a double edged sword. Not having the nature required to control it so easily, and being forced to adapt to the concept of emotion, the Wisp Queen's very long and hard life would eventually lead her to dealing with her feelings in a very unhealthy manner; by locking them away and attempting to forget their existence. The stronger she got, the stronger her Wisps became, and soon enough they began to evolve alongside their ruler. While X became more and more "human," her little Wisplings--being almost literal reflections of her consciousness--also underwent changes of their own.
<br><br>
<p align="center"><img style="height:40%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/WJMV3sf.jpg"/></p>
<br><br>
The overwhelming emotions she bottled up began to fester and grow in power until they began manifesting in her lesser spirits. No longer were they mere extensions of her psyche, now they had the capacity to feel and think for themselves, and they manifested the very forces she suppressed. The Fractals are the first step of the Will-o'-the-Wisp evolution, not yet having physical forms like their Queen, but actually retaining humanoid shape and humanistic mannerisms. They are small, but their strength is still great, and they are proof of a fascinating process of magical created life developing beyond its code all by itself.

<div id="tab2">
<h1>Contract with a Queen</h1>
Wonder has decided it would be beneficial for her and her alleged "Mother" figure to work together, and upon X's request, has accepted a contract that will make her the Wisp Queen's familiar. The source of their ties rests in a metal charm with a milky blue stone in its center that is currently fastened around her ghostly neck much like a collar.
<br>
<p align="center"><img style="height:40%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/D2CcZBb.png"/></p>
<br>
<b>Spirit Charm</b><br>
A small Blessed Item meant to be worn specifically by spiritual entities. If a consensual agreement is forged between the caster and the spirit they wish to give the charm to, its ability will tie the spirit to her as though they were a familiar. (This does not include passive buffs or the ability to channel spells through like a medium as Unity Familiars do, nor does it include the spirit being able to resummon after death with a cooldown. The only chance the being holding the charm has to continue after death is if a revival is possible just as it would be for any playable character or NPC. If the spirit cannot be saved, then the contract ends, and a replacement is required.)
<br>
The familiar will have its own set abilities it can use to serve its master, and the charm acts almost like a set of shackles, not allowing the creature that wears it to travel further than eighty feet from its master. Breaking the (diamond grade) charm will end the contract as well.
<br>
The Spirit Charm is not a slave's shackles, if the spirit wishes to end the contract at any time they are free to do so (as long as there is good reason for it), and can even remove the object from themselves to put their agreement on pause temporarily (charm can only have on active contract at a time, can't be switched between multiple spirits even if its contract holder has set the agreement on pause). This just means that if they wish to be free for a short time, have something important they need to do, need to leave the eighty foot limit for personal reasons, they are free to do so. When the agreement is on pause, they are no longer required to act as a familiar and do their chosen master's bidding, until it is unpaused again.
</div>

<div id="tab3">
<h1>Fractal Wisp's Racial Abilities</h1>
<b>Semi Intangibility</b><br>
As pure spirits, a Wisp cannot typically effect or be effected by the physical world, they require some form of physical catalyst through possession to even achieve a solid state. This means that any pure nonmagic physical objects can just phase through them as though they do not exist. Even some magical constructs or magically imbued items can still have no damaging power, assuming they are Mage rank or below. (The only exceptions to this rule are things specifically designed to harm the soul. Those will always do damage if they connect, regardless of rank.)
<br><br>
<b>Possession</b><br>
Wisps have the capacity to possess inanimate nonmagic objects (and inanimate magic objects of Mage rank or lower). While possessing an object, they can manipulate it within reasonable limits of that object's capabilities (for example, hopping a table around for short distances would be possible, but making said table grow new additions it did not have before would not be). Destroying or damaging a possessed item will in turn damage the Wisp manifesting within it.
<br>
This racial can work in tandem with their hovering ability so long as the object they are possessing doesn't weigh more than 100 lbs. (If it weighs 200+ lbs. they can't move or shift it around at all.)
<br><br>
<b>Ghostly Hovering</b><br>
Gravity does not seem to have much of an effect on the ethereal, allowing Wisps to hover freely within twenty foot of the nearest solid surface. Their speed isn't any faster than base human, but weightlessness makes hovering near effortless, and can be equated to the skill with which a fish swims through the water; it's like they're made for it!
<br><br>
<b>Reality Ripple</b><br>
Having been designed to be able to weave apart holes in reality so they can freely move between planes of existence, leaves a Wisp with the ability to do just that. (Never allowed in combat, always requires asking permission from the Gamemaster first before it can be used, is a lore/plot element ONLY. Can only be used once every 24 hour period.)
</div>

<div id="tab4">
<h1>Contracted Magical Abilities</h1>
They are indeed magical creatures on their own, but accepting the role of a Familiar has limited Wonder to which spells she can and can't use, so long as her contract lasts. She has been confined down to the following:
<br><br>
<b>Gathering Knowledge</b><br>
Wide wonder-filled eyes do everything they can to absorb as much information as possible, more specifically about the spirit world. The Fractal Wisp is capable of sensing other spirits or souls within a forty foot radius of herself, even if they are being intentionally hidden as long as the spell hiding them isn't greater than High Archmage (including things like True Practitioner, their spells would be unaffected) in rank. If she happens to catch another spirit being used for a spell and being intentionally hidden, another more complicated part of this spell becomes accessible to her. Assuming all previous conditions are met, she can engage a studying phase that requires her to constantly watch the actions and behaviors of the other hidden entity for two rotations. All of her focus must be devoted to watching the spirit, and for both of those rotations she must remain within fifteen feet of them to better "see" them. (If this phase is interrupted at any point the whole process must start completely over to be able to recast another hopefully more successful attempt. Every instance of recasting costs more mana.)
<br>
Once the study period is over, if it is completed successfully, Wonder will be able to mimic the set ability the spell gives that spirit for half of the duration the original spirit would usually be able to carry it out. (OOC Agreements will often require to be made, if there is any reason at all someone feels she should not be able to mimic the ability then it can be freely called into question and a third opinion can be asked to settle the matter.)
